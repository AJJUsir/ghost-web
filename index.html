            <img src="bhoot only.png" alt="About Ridhi">
            <p>Ridhi, lovingly called Bhoot, is a very cute girl living in Gorakhpur. She belongs to Lachvar village in Bihar. She is currently in 9th class at Divine public school in Gorakhpur and aspires to become a doctor, preparing for the NEET exam.She likes to be alone and loves nature. At school, she talks a lot, but at home, she stays quiet. Despite her name being "Bhoot," she is afraid of ghosts. Her best friend's name is Tania, and she loves her very much. She and her friends often give scary nicknames to their teachers and tease them. She always tries to show others that she is a fun-loving girl, but deep down, she feels lonely.  </p>

        <h3>Her Dreams</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="tourist bhoot.png" alt="Her Dreams">
            <p>Although her dream is to become a doctor, she also dreams of going to mountainous areas on a beautiful day, wearing a black rider dress and riding a black bullet motorcycle, alone and in peace, to chill and understand her own solitude. She enjoys visiting religious places like Badrinath and Kedarnath, where she can find tranquility. She always writes her life experiences in a diary. I believe the person with whom she shares her feelings will be very lucky, as such a person is rare. I hope her dream will come true soon.</p>

However, she loves her sister Preeti the most. Preeti is her cousin, her tau jiâ€™s daughter. She always prefers to stay with her sister. She shares all her secrets and thoughts with Preeti. The two of them have their own unique world where they are very happy together. But since her sister got married and became a cute sister-in-law, she constantly talks about her. Her sister-in-law loves to laugh and enjoys making others laugh as well, so this happy cycle continues. Until then, you can read on to know more about her..</p>

        <h3>From Her Brother-in-law</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="brother inlaws.png" alt="From Her Brother-in-law">
            <p>As mentioned earlier, her sister is married to my brother, which means we are also part of her small world, especially my brother. The spirit, or the bond, seems to have a strong connection with my brother, though I am not entirely sure how deep it runs. However, it is evident that she always enjoys his company, and they cherish the moments they share whenever they meet. So far, they have met properly only once, but despite this, they have become best friends. Now, when it comes to me, I am her younger brother-in-law. Often, our brothers and their sisters tease us, but we don't take their words to heart; instead, we enjoy the banter. Yet, for some reason, they have labeled me as shy in front of everyone, which I am not. One very important thing to mention is that while I can talk a lot and have much to say, I tend not to speak much in front of her. This doesn't mean I am shy or anything; it simply takes me a little time to understand and process everything. So, this is all about my brother, your sister, and me..</p>
